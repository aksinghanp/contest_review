//Minimum Impossible OR
We say that an integer x is expressible from nums if there exist some integers
0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length for which nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x. 
In other words, an integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR of some subsequence of nums.
Return the minimum positive non-zero integer that is not expressible from nums.
Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: 4

solution:
hm 2 ki nayi power ni bna sakte h
isiliye min positive power of 2 hi answer hoga
